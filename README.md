# COVID-TwitterDiscourse
Final Project- DS-GA-1003

We are interested in the analysis of political discourse on Twitter in the US with respect to the ongoing COVID-19pandemic. The motivation behind this analysis is to identify political narratives that harnessed more support among the users of the micro-blogging site and that were pushed by different news agencies owing to their implicit political bias. To build the training corpus, we will utilize tweets made by the US Governors hailing from Democratic or Republican parties in a specific timeframe, allowing us an efficient way to identify and label tweets representing discourse pushed from either side of the political spectrum to deal with the same crisis. Using the trained model, we intend to analyze the Twitter accounts of all major US news outlets to identify the support for either of these political discourses and whether their stance evolved over time. For possible future work, another application of the model could be used to track real-time twitter sentiments in response to real-world events such as, how do the postings on the platform evolve following events, such as the White House briefings.
